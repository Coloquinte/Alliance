# Ignoring files via cvsignore
# 
# There are certain file names that frequently occur inside your working copy, but that you don't want to put under CVS control.
# Examples are all the object files that you get while you compile your sources. Normally, when you run `cvs update', it prints a
# line for each file it encounters that it doesn't know about (see section update output). 
# 
# CVS has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns) that it should ignore while running update, import and release. This list is
# constructed in the following way. 
# 
#       The list is initialized to include certain file name patterns: names associated with CVS administration, or with other common
#       source control systems; common names for patch files, object files, archive files, and editor backup files; and other names
#       that are usually artifacts of assorted utilities. Currently, the default list of ignored file name patterns is:   
# 
#           RCS     SCCS    CVS     CVS.adm
#           RCSLOG  cvslog.*
#           tags    TAGS
#           .make.state     .nse_depinfo
#           *~      #*      .#*     ,*      _$*     *$
#           *.old   *.bak   *.BAK   *.orig  *.rej   .del-*
#           *.a     *.olb   *.o     *.obj   *.so    *.exe
#           *.Z     *.elc   *.ln  
#           core

# *.Z
# *.elc
# *.exe
# *.ln
# *.obj
# *.olb
# *.old
# *.orig
# *.rej
# ,*
# .#*
# _$*
# 
#       The per-repository list in `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore' is appended to the list, if that file exists. 
#       The per-user list in `.cvsignore' in your home directory is appended to the list, if it exists. 
#       Any entries in the environment variable $CVSIGNORE is appended to the list. 
#       Any `-I' options given to CVS is appended. 
#       As CVS traverses through your directories, the contents of any `.cvsignore' will be appended to the list. The patterns
#       found in `.cvsignore' are only valid for the directory that contains them, not for any sub-directories. 
# 
# In any of the 5 places listed above, a single exclamation mark (`!') clears the ignore list. This can be used if you want to store
# any file which normally is ignored by CVS.
