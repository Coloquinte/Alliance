**********   SSI counted link viewing utilities   **********

The files, utility.txt, linkcount.cgi, linkname.cgi, and  
webmster.shtml are intended as free utility additions to LOGCOUNT.
Link counts can be viewed via LogLook. However should you wish
to add certain ones to a secure webmasters master page without
using LogLook all the time... for example, or display a counted 
hyperlink with the current total next to it, then the scripts
linkcount.cgi and linkname.cgi can be utilised via SSI calls.

So, LogCount can be used to keep a count of each "counted link"
you install on your site. If you use this facility, it is a simple 
matter of renaming linkcount.cgi or linkname.cgi to the name of 
EACH of your installed counted links you want to display on SSI web
pages, ie link1.cgi and link2.cgi etc, and placing each new 
copy of the script into your cgi-bin (chmod 755).

The name must match the link name exactly, U/L case included.

Sample SSI calls are in the scripts plus in the html code of
the additional "webmster.shtml" file (with <!--comments-->).

Contact me at somename@dtp-aus.com for assistance or to report
its usefulness. As with logcnt.cgi and loglook.cgi, you do not
have to be registered for basic support etc, but general program 
installation e-mail help is NOT available as these are not 
beginners programs.   Thank you - Ron.
