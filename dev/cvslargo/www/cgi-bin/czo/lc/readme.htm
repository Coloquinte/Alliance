        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2" color="#FF0000">Version 3.8</font><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"> includes some important set up changes and enhancements to LogLook and a new page counting option - LogCount is a proper site counter - <a href="#38new">see history above</a>.</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>v3.5</b> LogLook included administrative options for creating, editing, resetting, and deleting counted hyperlinks. The tag for any counted hyperlink can be readily generated for a simple copy and paste in to web pages. The tags for all counter methods can also be readily generated via LogLook for simple copy and paste in to web pages, plus several other setup options can be changed.</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>pre v3.3 UPGRADE</b><br>
          Pre version 3.3 users will find several new variables in the config file. Also note the renaming of both the config and GMT files. If you are using other dtp-aus.com programs sharing the &quot;sets&quot; sub directory, either rename the gmt file reference in those other programs or change the new file name.
This has occurred because gradually all programs will be using require files with the extension &quot;.pl&quot;. The new LogCount and LogLook programs can upload over v3.3 - <i>unless the previous have been altered... and I cannot help.</i></font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b><font size="3">Once installed</font></b><br>
          <b>It is strongly suggested</b> that LogLook be the first program to test. The simple mistakes often made in setting up counter tags can be misleading and many inexperienced people assume wrongly when fault tracking. By using LogLook first, once it works and options can be changed, or even if the error reports inbuilt are generated, then most of the installation can be then be assumed as correct and later counter tags can be looked at with more confidence.</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Then install the webmasters access page even if not going to use the supplied one! This includes a couple of NON-counting visible counters to check paths etc. All digits should show zero unless you manually add a count to the count file - see variables below</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">PROPERLY SET UP the programs CANNOT be accessed from remote pages containing links to them OR a browser command line - this is a <a href="#refs">first level security feature</a> and <b>INCLUDES YOU</b>!</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">All relevant files are
    supplied in one compressed .zip file that includes the recommended
    directory structure. It is assumed that the .zip file has been
    uncompressed to the directory structure included in the .zip
    file on your local pc before proper FTP uploading - keep perl programs away from MSFrontPage and other site posting wysiwyg editors!</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">You MUST alter all reference
    to &quot;yourdomain.name&quot; in the config 'require' files plus the
    webmasters page, and change the configuration variables, as described
    in this Readme text. Also set up the paths and URLs correctly in both program config files in the sets directory (<b>the &quot;sets&quot; directory</b> is used by all dtp-aus.com programs and will achieve even greater importance in the near future - currently the GMT config file is accessed/can be changed by all dtp-aus.com programs <i>ie</i> one change upgrades all programs!).</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Firstly, a few explanations.
    LogCount does not use in-built count images, allowing you to
    use any counter image &quot;sets&quot; that are readily available
    via the Internet. These sets must include 10 images, displaying
    0 - 9, and when placed in the appropriate directory (folder),
    they must be named or renamed &quot;0.gif&quot; through to &quot;9.gif&quot;.
    </font><font size="2"><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">*Note*</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica"> The clock option, if used, requires
    conversion of any of your current images to a full colon ( :
    ) named &quot;-.gif&quot;, an image displaying &quot;am&quot;
    named &quot;a.gif&quot;, and one displaying &quot;pm&quot; named
    &quot;p.gif&quot;.</FONT></font></P>
        <P><font color="#000099" face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Both of
    the supplied image sets have been updated</font><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">
    with these images (to display the clock on any page, see &quot;<B>Displaying
    The Clock</B>&quot; <a href="#tags">below</a>).</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Extra server resources
    are not called upon by calling additional &quot;on call&quot;
    programs that create the images. The only loss here is the ability
    to add &quot;pretty&quot; borders to the count display. Logcount,
    and Loglook scripts are designed for conservative tracking and analysing visitor
    trends and page popularity etc, so it is suggested that the majority
    of pages only include the simple &quot;Hidden Counter&quot; options.
    Small conservative light and dark background count images are
    supplied.</font></P>

    </FONT></B><FONT FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">Like myself with
    www.dtp-aus.com, Hosting services are being used now that are
    &quot;remote&quot; from ones local ISP service. Normally this
    means that all of our scripts etc report dates and times different
    to that of our local access points, ie our home locality from
    where we view our sites. To overcome this I use a Perl facility
    that allows us to use (G)reenwich (M)ean (T)ime with an offset
    reference reporting in my local time and date. One of the perl
    &quot;Include&quot; files, 'gmt.set', contains a variable name

    - whose value MUST be set for your local GMT offset. I live in
    a world time zone 15 hours ahead of that of my Host Servers.
    Therefore, when I set the variable to 36000 (GMT+10hrs), the
    server logs record, and I view, all dates and times relevant
    to my locality irrespective of where my Hosting service is. With
    this method I can move my Domain and the results would not change.</font></P>

    in the 'cntcnfg.set' file assume you will place these files in
    your cgi-bin and add a directory to it called &quot;counters&quot;.
    If you have to use other directory names, or your &quot;cgi-bin&quot;
    has a different name, then you will have to change the paths
    accordingly; &quot;cgi-yourdomain&quot; is not uncommon. There
    are three path types that can be used at various times with in
    a program or script. A full URL is the same as the path you enter
    in your browsers address box when typing in a site path that
    you wish to go to: ie 'http://www.wooz.com/harry.htm'. A relative
    path is a path description to a source, relative to the directory
    of the program, file or web page that is calling it: ie &quot;jimbo.htm&quot;
    means that the file being called should be in the same directory.
    &quot;inone/jimbo.htm&quot; refers to a file that should be in
    a directory named 'inone' which is a directory within the current
    directory, and &quot;../jimbo.htm&quot; means that the file should
    be in a directory one above the current directory, and &quot;../../jimbo.htm&quot;
    is in a directory two above etc.</FONT></font></P>
        <P><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">For some servers, a simple
    relative path called by a script is unacceptable, so a path relative
    to the sites root directory must be called. There are also variations
    to this description but &quot;web/yourdomain/yourdirectory/jimbo.htm&quot;
    (example only) is a relative root path description that works
    on many servers. Another root path is &quot;/home/yourdomain/www/yourdirectory/jimbo.htm&quot;.
    If you have trouble with accessing the default simple relative
    paths included in the 'cntcnfg.set' file, try the root reference
    ie &quot;web/yourdomain/cg-bin/counters/hitcount.t&quot; etc.
    If this is still a problem, look in any installed scripts on
    your server for a reference, or contact your hosting support

    files and new directories. Bitmap images must be sent to the
    server using the &quot;Binary&quot; protocol. Text files, ie
    html pages, CGI SCRIPTS and require files, MUST be sent in &quot;ASCII&quot;
    format. Failure to do this will result in a server failing to
    recognise and execute the scripts. Although often referred to
    as programs, scripts must be compiled before they do anything.
    As an example, files with the .EXE extension on programs that
    are installed on Wintel machines are pre-compiled binary executable
    programs. Perl scripts on the other hand are compiled in memory
    by Perl before they can be executed. The script (text) must be

          <font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Supplied with LogCount and LogLook was a simple SSI program that could be copied and renamed with the name given to a counted hyperlink (ie &quot;<b>widgets</b>.cgi&quot;). As of version 3.5b that one script was replaced by two scripts. &quot;<b>linkname.cgi</b>&quot; works the same as the previous 'somename' in that it displays only the link total for the counted hyperlink it is named after, and now &quot;<b>linkcount.cgi</b>&quot; will display the actual hyperlink tag followed by the count total for the counted hyperlink it is named after.</font>
        <P><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Because they are SSI programs the SSI call  has to be placed in the texts of an SSI html page, ie pagename.shtml, pagename.sht. You have to know if your host service allows SSI HTML pages before using these programs. </font></P>
        <P><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">So by placing this code calling the  <b>linkname.cgi</b> script now copied and renamed barts.cgi (the name barts is the name of a hyperlink created in the LogLook admin pages):<br>
          <font color="#000099">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File downloaded &lt;!--#exec cgi=&quot;/cgi-bin/barts.cgi&quot;--&gt; times.</font></font>
<font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><br>

          <font color="#CC0033">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File downloaded 2033 times.</font></font>
<font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><br>
          <i>OR</i><br>
          by placing this code calling the <b>linkcount.cgi</b> script  now copied and renamed  Bonzo-Zip.cgi (the name Bonzo-Zip is the name of a hyperlink created in the LogLook admin pages):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000099">Down Load &lt;!--#exec cgi=&quot;/cgi-bin/Bonzo-Zip.cgi&quot;--&gt;.</font></font>

        <P><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">You can of course also use the standard hyperlink counting method:<br>
          <font color="#000099">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yourdomain.name/cgi-bin/logcnt.cgi?<b>l</b>=linkname&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;
</font><br>
          followed by the &quot;linkname.cgi&quot; renaming method:<br>
          <font color="#000099">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!--#exec cgi=&quot;/cgi-bin/barts.cgi&quot;--&gt;
</font><br>
          to add the count where and how you want. This way you can place it all in the pages texts if the above &quot;linkcount.cgi&quot; method is difficult to include in a manner that makes sense.</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">So I have included the two utility scripts giving you three SSI counted link options  PLUS the standard counted link method generated in the LogLook admin page. Either way for displaying the count next to a counted ink, or just the including the count  total in the pages text will work as long as the page is an SSI named and enabled page. Notes for renaming these two cgi scripts are also in the script header.</font><a name="lnks"></a>                         </P>

    </font></b><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica">LogCount can be
    used to log the number of times visitors use specific hyperlinks
    on your web pages. Both links from one page to another local
    page, or links to other sites can be included. The call is a
    simple change to the &quot;A HREF tag that you wish to track,
    ie:</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="courier,courier new" size="2">&lt;a href=&quot;http://yourdomain.name/cgi-bin/logcnt.cgi?l=3&quot;&gt;hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;</font><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><br>

    src....&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</font><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">The question mark denotes
    the start of the query string that follows it. The &quot;<b>l</b>&quot;
    is a lowercase &quot;L&quot;, NOT a numeric 1. The &quot;<b>l</b>&quot;
    tells LogCount to handle the query as a hyper(l)ink. After the
    &quot;=&quot; sign is a number in the first example and a word
    in the second example. I have shown this so you can see that
    this is indeed a name, and numbers could be used while words
    could be more descriptive. The name refers to an identical name
    entered in the Link List file, 'hitlnk.t', that you must configure
    if using this option.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Also in the examples are
    two hyperlinked objects, a simple text link in the first example
    and an image link in the second. If you want your link to open
    another browser window then include the standard 'target=&quot;_blank&quot;'
    attribute ie:</font></p>
        <p><font face="courier,courier new" size="2">&lt;a href=&quot;http://yourdomain.name/cgi-bin/logcnt.cgi?l=widget&quot;
    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b><font color="#FF0000">Note v3.5</font></b> The counted hyperlinks can now be set up via the LogLook admin page, plus the tag for each named link can also be readily generated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">I have included an example
    'hitlnk.t' file for you to configure and up load to the &quot;counters&quot;
    directory (default). In this file you will identify four example
    links, and they include the special &quot;<b>|</b>&quot; vertical
    line character. The item pattern is as follows: Name<b>|</b>Link<b>|</b>Count,
    ie <br>
    &quot;</font><font face="courier,courier new" size="2">widget<b>|</b>http://www.widgetstuff.com/<b>|</b>0</font><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">&quot;.<br>
    The third item, the count value must be set initially to zero
    &quot;0&quot;. You can configure as many hyperlink click records
    as you wish, but do not apply them to all of your links just
    because you can. This is an excellant way of analysing how many
    visitors leave your site to other sites you link to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">The second page of LogLook
    will display the count progress of your links. Each listed link
    shown by LogLook includes an embedded hyperlink to logcnt.cgi
    allowing you to occasionally check that the call is working and
    not a broken link.<a name="llk"></a></font></p>

Use the admin page to regularly &quot;prune&quot; dates from the log; once viewed, trends noted, days compared, there is realy little need to keep old dates in the log.

          I have created a simple utility script that can be placed in your cgi-bin and run from your browsers command line. This script will, in almost all cases, detect the Perl version you are using and report its findings. If it reports version 4 as a default, then you must ask your Host Service for the correct path to Perl 5 (Always top and FIRST line in all scripts). LogCount and LogLook are Perl 5 programs for Unix servers.</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Testbin.cgi will attempt to get all perl paths from the server and list them at the bottom of its page. Not all servers will make this information available.</font></P>
        <P><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Testbin.cgi can also be used to test your path to &quot;Sendmail&quot;. The program will attempt to get this information from the server but not all will make it available. <b>To test the Sendmail path you MUST</b> change the variable value near the top of the code which is the URL to the testbin program!</font></P>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><i><b>So!</b></i><br>
          Place &quot;testbin.cgi&quot; in your cgi-bin directory and chmod 755 (7=r+w+x, 5=r+x).<br>

</b><br>
          I have created a simple utility script that can be placed in your cgi-bin and run from your browsers command line. If your server allows directory creation via cgi scripts, then this utility will attempt to create the default (recommended) directories and file names for you, and set the permissions. It is unprotected and there is no guarantee that it will work; try it at your own risk (<i>disclaimer only</i>). It has worked well on many sites.

</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Try installing and running this script first. It will report success or failure when creating the files/directories and prove the correctness of your Perl Path", plus indicate that the default relative paths will work OK. If the default urls/paths are not used, then you will have to change them first.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">

To use it, make sure the "Perl Path" at the top of the script is correct. <font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE</b></font>: the default Dir/File permissions are set to 766. Change these values to 777 if your site so requires BEFORE running the script. If running the script is successful, you only have to FTP your supplied files over the new empty ones. (note: for security reasons, makedir does NOT prepare an empty file for the cgi scripts, you must upload them (as ascii) and set chmod 755 your self). </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">777 for sub directories and 766 for files is probably the most common in a well set-up true cgi-bin directory.

</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Once run, delete the file immediately because it has no input protection and could be run again by some low-life wanting to cause mischief
