This file discuss about installation of Alliance on UNIX machines.


# Downloading and installing binary distribution :
# ===================================================================

If you don't find the exact precompiled package for your system, or if you 
have trouble with a package, please consider downloading the sources 
and build them. 

Note that for running some precompiled Alliance binaries you will need gcc and
other gnu tools (gmake, gcc ...), X11R6.4 libraries (http://www.x.org/), Motif
1.2 libraries. You can find a semi free Motif distribution at 
http://www.motifzone.net/ and a free clone at http://www.lesstif.org/.
If you use Linux RedHat 7.1 you'll find 2 openmotif rpm in 
ftp://asim.lip6.fr/pub/alliance/distribution/5.0/redist/rh7.1/
If you use RedHat 7.3 or 8.0, install the 3 openmotif rpm found on the 
RedHat cdroms (especially the openmotif21 rpm which is a compatibility library
for Open Motif 2.1 that can be installed with the openmotif-2.2.


Alliance naming scheme:
=======================

- sources: alliance-XXX-YYY.tar.gz
    where:
        XXX = Alliance version number. eg 5.0
        YYY = Alliance release number, wich is the date of the build. eg 20020624

- binaries: alliance-XXX-YYY-ZZZ.KKK
    where:
        XXX, YYY = same as above.
        ZZZ = indicate the platform target
        KKK = archive type (gzipped tar or rpm)


To install a tar.gz package (*nix)
----------------------------------

Get the latest binary package for your platform, 
log as root then type :

> cd /usr/local
> tar -xzf /mnt/cdrom/alliance-5.0-XXX-YYY.tar.gz
> ln -s /usr/local/alliance/etc/alc_env.csh /etc/profile.d/
> ln -s /usr/local/alliance/etc/alc_env.sh /etc/profile.d/


To install a .rpm package (Linux redHat 7+)
-------------------------------------------

This rpm has been build on a modified RedHat 7.1 and requires: ld-linux.so.2
libICE.so.6 libSM.so.6 libX11.so.6 libXext.so.6 libXm.so.2 libXp.so.6
libXpm.so.4 libXt.so.6 libc.so.6 libm.so.6 libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 /bin/sh
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.0) libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.1) libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.1.3)
libm.so.6(GLIBC_2.0). 
(You can generate the rpm for your platform by issuing :
 rpm -ta alliance-5.0-XXX.tar.gz)

Get the latest rpm package,
log as root then type :

> rpm -Uvh alliance-5.0-YYY.rpm


# Building from the sources :
# ===================================================================

Alliance's sources are now conforming to GNU's automake/autoconf.

1/ Get the latest alliance-5.0-YYY.tar.gz archive.

2/ Unarchive it

> tar xzf alliance-5.0-XXX.tar.gz

3/ The install stage has to be done at the same time 
   as the make itself : the way the configure and Makefiles 
   are written implies that you do a "make install" in one 
   step rather than a "make" followed by a "make install"

   To avoid make problems, please use gnu make (gmake)
   The fowllowing commands builds the full package from scratch.

> export ALLIANCE_TOP=/usr/local/alliance
> ./configure --prefix=$ALLIANCE_TOP
> gmake install

All this is done by a script called ./build in the alliance directory.



# Usage :
# ===================================================================

Each user has to source alc_env.[c]sh to set Alliance environment
variables to be able to run the Alliance tools.

in sh  > . [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/etc/alc_env.sh

in csh > source [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/etc/alc_env.csh

This sets various default environment variables which could be changed by user
later (Like MBK_OUT_LO to set the netlist output file format).

If you are a SysAdmin, you should consider linking these scripts in 
the system's profile (e.g.: /etc/profile.d/ on Linux) so that configuration
would be done at user login.
