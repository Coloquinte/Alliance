.SH NAME
.PP
\fBfsm\fP - Alliance VHDL Finite State Machine description subset.

.so man1/alc_origin.1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This document describes the Alliance VHDL subset for Finite State Machine description.

.br
This FSM subset is neither accepted by the logic simulator \fBasimut\fP(1),
nor the formal prover \fBproof\fP(1).

.br
This VHDL subset is defined to enable classical MOORE and MEALEY synchronous
finite state machine description as well as stack FSM description (see \fBsyf\fP(1) 
for further information about this kind of FSM).
.br
A FSM description is made of two and only two processes.
Connectors and signals can only be of \fBin\fP, \fBout\fP, and two user defined
enumerated types.
Vectors of \fBin\fP and \fBout\fP types are also allowed.
.br
FSM's states and stack control signals must be declared as enumerated type.
.br
For the scan-path, three more signals are required :
.RS
- scan_test: in bit
.br
- scan_in: in bit
.br
- scan_out: out bit
.RE
.br
For a ROM implementation, the vdd and vss signals must be explicitely declared as :
.RS
.br
- rom_vdd : in bit
.br
- rom_vss : in bit
.SH
These signals, declared in the interface, are not used or assigned in the FSM description.
The '-P' option of \fBsyf\fP(1) allows scan-path implementation.
.br
.PP
Pragmas :
.br
.RS
A pragma is a comment that gives necessary informations to the synthesis and formal
proof tools.
.br

Three pragmas are used, their generic names are :
.br
.RS
- CLOCK : External clock signal name.
.br
- CURRENT_STATE : Current State name.
.br
- NEXT_STATE : Next State name.
.SH
Ten other pragmas are optional.
.br
Three pragmas are required only for scan-path implementation.
.br
.RS
- SCAN_TEST : Enable test mode (scan-path).
.br
- SCAN_IN : scan-path input.
.br
- SCAN_OUT : scan-path output.
.br
.SH
Five others are used only in a STACK FSM.
.br
.RS
- RETURN_STATE : Return State name.
.br
- CONTROL : Stack Control signal name.
.br
- POP : POP operation on the stack.
.br
- PUSH : PUSH operation on the stack.
.br
- NOP : NOP operation on the stack.
.SH
The last ones for ROM implementation
.RS
- ROM_VDD : Name of the vdd signal of the ROM.
.br
- ROM_VSS :Name of the vss signal of the ROM.

.SH
.br
Two different processes are used : The first process, called state process,
allows to describe state transition and outputs generation.
It is not controlled by the clock.
The second process is controlled by the clock and descibes the state 
register and stack registers modifications. 
.br
State process sensitivity list contains inputs and CURRENT_STATE, it means 
that the state process is activated when the CURRENT_STATE or an input signal changes. 
A case statement is used to describe, for each state, the next state and outputs.
.br
The second process sensitivity list contains the clock signal, so this process 
is enabled whenever clock changes.
Both Level sensitive latches, and falling edge triggered flip flops can be used for
state registers and stack implementation.
