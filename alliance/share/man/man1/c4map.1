.SH NAME

c4map   
\- mapping of a behavioural description with the CMOS Complex Cell Compiler : C4.

.so man1/alc_origin.1

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBc4map\fP  \fIdata_flow_file\fP \fIoutput_file\fP  [\fIparameter_file\fP]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.br

.br
\fB  Input description\fP
.br

.br
The logic level behavioural description (.vbe file) uses the same VHDL subset as the logic simulator \fBasimut\fP, the FSM synthesizer \fBsyf\fP, the functional abstractor \fByagle\fP and the formal prover \fBproof\fP (for further information about the subset of VHDL, see the "vbe" manual). 
.br
A special feature has been introduced in the VHDL subset in order to allow the don't care description for external outputs and internal registers : A bit signal can take the 'd' value. 
This value is interpreted as a '0' by the logic simulator \fBasimut\fP. 
Don't Cares are automatically generated by \fBsyf\fP in the resulting '.vbe' file.
.br
For the register signal, only one signal can appear in a guarded expression since the STABLE attribute is used. This attribute is only supported by technology mapping onto a standard cell library as \fBsclib\fP. 
.br
\fBc4map\fP is the second step of the logic synthesis : it builds a gate network 
invoking a CMOS complex cell compiler called C4
.br

.br
\fB  Mapping with C4\fP
.br

.br
There is no predefined cell library. A decomposition phase is performed on the behavioural description such that each of the logic function are feasible by the C4 compiler. The C4 compiler then generates dynamically the cells througouht the following views :  layout , transistor network and behavioural including data-sheet informations.
The generated cells have the same height and topology as the SCLIB cells. So the synthesized block is still routable using SCR (or any standard cell router).
C4 generates dual CMOS gates. The maximum number of serial transistors N (resp. P) is a parameter. The name of the cells generated by C4 is computed according to the expression representing its associated logic function. The operator (o for OR, a for AND) is written in a prefixed notation while the arity (inputs number of the operator) is written in a postfixed notation. A "n" is added for the negative cells.
.br
.br
\fBExample\fP :    F = not ((a and b) or c);     name = noa22
.br
.br
Each cell generated by C4 is dynamically characterized with a RC model and the electrical informations are added to the behavioural description. A technology parameter file is used during this process.
.br

.br
\fB  Parameter file '.lax'\fP
.br
The parameter file is common with other logic synthesis tools and is used
for driving the synthesis process. 
See \fBlax\fP(5) manual for more detail.

.br
\fBlax\fP uses a lot of parameters to guide every step of the synthesis process.
Some parameters are globally used (for example, \fIoptimization level\fP whereas others are specifically used (\fBload capacitance\fP for the netlist optimization only).
Here is the default parameter file (see the user's manual for further information about the syntax of the '.lax' file):
.br

.br
   Optimization mode = 2 (50% area - 50% delay)
.br
   Optimization level = 2 
.br
   Delayed input = 0
.br
   Early output = 0
.br
   Auxiliary signal saved = 0
.br
   Number of serial transistors = 4 in N and P area
.br



.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

\fIMBK_CATA_LIB\fP gives the auxiliary paths of the directories of input files (behavioural description). 
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_TARGET_LIB\fP gives the path (single) of the directory of the selected standard cell library. 
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_C4_LIB\fP gives the path (single) of the directory for the three views of each cell generated by C4.
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_IN_LO\fP gives the format of models instantiated in the structural description.
.HP
.ti 7
