.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBscmap\fP  \fIdata_flow_file\fP \fIoutput_file\fP  [\fIparameter_file\fP]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.br

.br
\fB  Input description\fP
.br

.br
The logic level behavioural description (.vbe file) uses the same VHDL subset as the logic simulator \fBasimut\fP, the FSM synthesizer \fBsyf\fP, the functional abstractor \fByagle\fP and the formal prover \fBproof\fP (for further information about the subset of VHDL, see the "vbe" manual). 
.br
A special feature has been introduced in the VHDL subset in order to allow the don't care description for external outputs and internal registers : A bit signal can take the 'd' value. 
This value is interpreted as a '0' by the logic simulator \fBasimut\fP. 
Don't Cares are automatically generated by \fBsyf\fP in the resulting '.vbe' file.
.br
For the register signal, only one signal can appear in a guarded expression since the STABLE attribute is used. This attribute is only supported by technology mapping onto a standard cell library as \fBsclib\fP. 

\fBscmap\fP is the second step of the logic synthesis : it builds a gate network using
 a predefined standard cell library as SCLIB. 
.br

.br
\fB  Mapping with a standard cell library\fP
.br

.br
Every cell appearing in the directory defined by the environment variable MBK_TARGET_LIB may be used by \fBscmap\fP since they are described as a '.vbe' file. There are some restrictions about the type of the cell used. Every cell has to have only one output. For the combinational cells, two levels maximum (AND-OR or OR-AND) are required for the logical function.
The cell must be characterized. The timing and area informations required by \fBscmap\fP are specified in the "generic" clause of the ".vbe" file.
.br

.br
\fB  Parameter file '.lax'\fP
.br
The parameter file is common with other logic synthesis tools and is used
for driving the synthesis process. 
See \fBlax\fP(5) manual for more detail.

.br
\fBlax\fP uses a lot of parameters to guide every step of the synthesis process.
Some parameters are globally used (for example, \fIoptimization level\fP whereas others are specifically used (\fBload capacitance\fP for the netlist optimization only).
Here is the default parameter file (see the user's manual for further information about the syntax of the '.lax' file):
.br

.br
   Optimization mode = 2 (50% area - 50% delay)
.br
   Optimization level = 2 
.br
   Delayed input = 0
.br
   Early output = 0
.br
   Auxiliary signal saved = 0
.br
   Number of serial transistors = 4 in N and P area
.br



.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.br
The following environment variables have to be set before using \fBscmap\fP :
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_WORK_LIB\fP gives the path of the directory of both input and output files (behavioural, structural and parameters description).
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_CATA_LIB\fP gives the auxiliary paths of the directories of input files (behavioural description). 
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_TARGET_LIB\fP gives the path (single) of the directory of the selected standard cell library. 
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_C4_LIB\fP gives the path (single) of the directory for the three views of each cell generated by C4.
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_IN_LO\fP gives the format of models instantiated in the structural description.
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_OUT_LO\fP gives the output format of the structural description.
.HP
.ti 7
\fIMBK_OUT_PH\fP gives the output format for the layout of the cells generated by C4.


.SH EXAMPLE
.br
You can call \fBscmap\fP as follows :

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.br
"VHDL : Error - bad usage of the 'stable' attribut"
.br
The stable attribut must be used with only one signal in a guarded expression
