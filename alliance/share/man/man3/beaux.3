\fBbeaux\fP - BEH data structure

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIbeaux\fP is a data structure used in \fBBEH\fP to represent a one\-bit
simple internal signal. An internal signal is considered as a simple signal
when its value is set by one and only one driver.
For an array, each element is represented by a single structure.
These are organized in the reverse order of the array\'s range declaration.
\fIbeaux\fP has been designed to be used in a simply chained list.

.PP
A \fIbeaux\fP structure is composed of the following fields.

.TP 25
\fI(char *) NAME\fP
the signal\'s name. For an array\'s element, the name is the array\'s identifier
added to the element\'s index seperated by a \' \' (blank space).
This string is supposed been produced by \fBnamealloc()\fP
.TP 25
\fI(struct chain *) ABL\fP
signal\'s expression represented by an ABL
.TP 25
\fI(struct node *) BDD\fP
signal\'s expression represented by a BDD
.TP 25
\fI(struct beaux *) NEXT\fP
