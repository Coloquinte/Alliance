\fBbebux\fP - BEH data structure

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIbebux\fP is a data structure used in \fBBEH\fP to represent a one\-bit
bused internal signal. An internal signal is considered as a bused signal
when its value is set by at least one deconnectable driver.
For an array, each element is represented by a single structure.
These are organized in the reverse order of the array\'s range declaration.
\fIbebux\fP has been designed to be used in a simply chained list.

.PP
A \fIbebux\fP structure is composed of the following fields.

.TP 25
\fI(char *) NAME\fP
the signal\'s name. For an array\'s element, the name is the array\'s identifier
added to the element\'s index seperated by a \' \' (blank space).
This string is supposed been produced by \fBnamealloc()\fP
.TP 25
\fI(char) TYPE\fP
port\'s type : W (wor_bit) and, M (mux_bit)
.TP 25
\fI(struct biabl *) BIABL\fP
list of drivers using ABLs to represent expressions
.TP 25
\fI(struct binode *) BINODE\fP
list of drivers using BDDs to represent expressions
.TP 25
\fI(struct bebux *) NEXT\fP
next bebux
