.SH PARAMETER
.TP 20
\fIptfig\fP
Name of the figure to be created
.TP 20
\fIx\fP
Where the channel must be opened
.TP 20
\fIepsilon\fP
How much x can be changed
.TP 20
\fIwidth\fP
Width of the channel
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBOpenVerticalChannel\fP shifts toward the right all the instances
of \fIptfig\fP, which have an \fIXINS\fP greater than the \fIx\fP
passed. The value of the shift is determined by the fact that none
of the instances which will have an \fIXINS\fP greater than \fIx\fP
must overlap. If epsilon doesn't equal zero, \fBOpenVerticalChannel\fP
looks at all the positions between \fIx\fP-\fIepsilon\fP and
\fIx\fP+\fIepsilon\fP, so that the gap created by the channel is the
smallest possible. The \fIwidth\fP is added to the shift to find of
how much the \fIXINS\fP of the instances which are to be moved must
be increased. 
.br
\fIx\fP, \fIepsilon\fP and \fIwidth\fP must be a multiple of PITCH_X (defined in
scr.h).
.br
The least value recommended for \fIepsilon\fP is half the width of the largest
instance.
.br
Opening a channel is very fast (less than a second for 10 000 instances).
.br
\fBOpenVerticalChannel\fP returns a pointer to the modified \fIphfig\fP
.SH EXAMPLE

	long x;
.br
	x = (ptphfig->XAB2-ptphfig->XAB1)>>1;
.br
	x = x - x%PITCH_X;
.br
	return (OpenVerticalChannel (ptfig,x, 5*PITCH_X, 10*PITCH_X));
