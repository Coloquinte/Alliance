(Please read overview.ps before)

WARNING : These tutorials are not fully working and must be modified to
          work with Alliance 4.0 (especially the dlx), but we have 
          decided to release them even though they are not fully 
          functional. They will be upgraded as soon as we have time.

1/ ADDACCU
   The design of a very simple chip (adder/accumulator) to get started
   with the ALLIANCE tools.

   >cd tutorials/addaccu

2/ AMD2901
   The design of the 4 bits AMD2901 processor, from the VHDL specification to
   the CIF layout, using the ALLIANCE portable standard cells library.

   >cd tutorials/amd2901

4/ Synthesis
   Building simple door code using the Finite State Machine synthesizer (syf).

   >cd tutorials/synth

4/ Data Path
   Building simple data paths using on a procedural data path generator
   (fpgen) and a data path place and route tool (dpr).

   >cd tutorials/fitpath

5/ DlxM
   A complete tutorial based on the design of the 32 bit microprocessor DLX.
