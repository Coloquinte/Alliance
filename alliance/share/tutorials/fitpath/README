6. FpGen/DPR (Data-Path package) in the subdirectory "datapath".

This tutorial presents tools and methodology to design data-path with
Alliance. The two tools are:

    1 - FpGen : Data-Path netlists description language based upon C.
                (similar to GenLib)
    2 - DPR   : Place and route tool dedicated to Data-Path.

The Data-Path choosen as example is derivated from the "ADDACCU" tutorial.
We show five differents ways to build this Data-Path. Each way using a
specific Data-Path features. The five examples are the followings:

    1 -    sample_dpt : Basic Data-Path, use only standart features.
    2 -     place_dpt : Data-Path using optimized placement.
    3 -   usercol_dpt : Data-Path using a customized operator.
    4 - synthesis_dpt : Using logical synthesis to design a Data-Path
                          operator.
    5 - hierarchy_dpt : Using a hierarchical approach to describe a
                          datapath netlist.

To automatically build the examples fives shell scripts and a makefile
are provided.
