------------------------------

Alliance is a free VLSI CAD System.
You can read a general description of the ALLIANCE tools and libraries
in share/doc/overview.pdf or by printing the PostScript file overview.ps 
located in the doc directory:

> lpr share/doc/overview.ps

Question 4: How to get started ?
--------------------------------

You will find 5 separate tutorials in share/tutorials/ directory :
(Please read overview.ps before)

WARNING : These tutorials are not fully working and must be modified to
          work with Alliance 4.0 (especially the dlx), but we have 
          decided to release them even though they are not fully 
          functional. They will be upgraded as soon as we have time.

1/ ADDACCU
   The design of a very simple chip (adder/accumulator) to get started
   with the ALLIANCE tools.

   >cd tutorials/addaccu

2/ AMD2901
   The design of the 4 bits AMD2901 processor, from the VHDL specification to
   the CIF layout, using the ALLIANCE portable standard cells library.

   >cd tutorials/amd2901

4/ Synthesis
   Building simple door code using the Finite State Machine synthesizer (syf).

   >cd tutorials/synth

4/ Data Path
   Building simple data paths using on a procedural data path generator
   (fpgen) and a data path place and route tool (dpr).

   >cd tutorials/fitpath

5/ DlxM
   A complete tutorial based on the design of the 32 bit microprocessor DLX.




Question 5: What are the differences with the previous releases ?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The new features of this release are described in the CHANGES file:

> more CHANGES

Question 6: What is the supported VHDL subset ?
-----------------------------------------------

You can find a general presentation of the VHDL subset by issuing the
following commands:

> man vhdl

This gives you an hint about the supported VHDL subset.
There is actually three separate architectures types: "Structural",
"Data-flow", and "Finite-State-Machine"

> man vst

This gives you the VHDL subset supported for structural descriptions.

> man vbe

This gives you the data-flow behavioral subset supported by the simulator
ASIMUT, the logic synthesis tools BOP and SCMAP and the formal proffer PROOF.

> man fsm

This gives you the VHDL subset used for Finite-State-Machine description
and supported by the FSM synthesis tool SYF.

Question 7: What is the available online documentation ?
--------------------------------------------------------

Each tools has its own manual.
All the tools rely on the use of environment variables: all the relevant
variables are listed in the `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES' section of the manual
page.

Question  8: How can I get more complete documentation ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

All the available documentation for Alliance can be found
at Alliance's web site : 
http://www-asim.lip6.fr/alliance/doc/

You can download a copy of this site at 
ftp://ftp-asim.lip6.fr/pub/alliance/distribution/doc/

Question 9:  Where are defined the symbolic layout rules ?
----------------------------------------------------------

The symbolic layout rules are specified in the Design Rule Checker
documentation:

> man druc

Question 10:  How is performed the mapping to a target process ?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The actual conversion is performed by the s2r tool:

> man s2r

If you want to parameterize the S2R tool to a new target technology,
you must write a technology file. The method is described in the
postscript file doc/process_mapping.ps (also available in pdf)

> lpr doc/process_mapping.ps


Question 11: What are the supported file formats ?
--------------------------------------------------

ALLIANCE tools are interfaced to generic data-structures that
support various standard file formats, thanks to a set of
specialized parsers/drivers.
UNIX environment variables are used to select one particular file format.
For a given entity, the file format is defined by the file extension.

Question 12: Where are TAS and YAGLE ?
--------------------------------------

HITAS (Hierarchical timing analysis) and YAGLE (Functional abstraction)
are now comercially distributed by Avertec (http://www.avertec.com/).
More information can be obtained at their web site. Binaries of these
tools can also be downloaded for non-commercial university research.
