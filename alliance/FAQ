Question 1: What is ALLIANCE ?
------------------------------

Alliance is a free VLSI CAD System.
You can read a general description of the ALLIANCE tools and libraries
by printing the PostScript files overview.ps located in the doc
directory:

> lpr share/doc/overview.ps


Question 2: What is ALLIANCE general copyright policy ?
-------------------------------------------------------

"Alliance VLSI CAD System" is free Software.

Unlike versions of Alliance up to 3.1 that where released
including sources, version 3.2 and up will not be available
with the source code.

Source is however still available, but only upon request to
alliance-support@lip6.fr. The release of the source is now
subject to a non disclosure agreement.

You are welcome to use the software package even for commercial 
designs whithout any fee. You are just required to mention : 
"Designed with Alliance CAD system"

> more LICENCE

Question 3: How to install ALLIANCE ?
-------------------------------------

Binary packcages are available for :
	- i386 Linux_elf
	- sparc SunOS 4.1.1
	- sparc Solaris 5.5.1
To install Alliance follow the steps written in README

> more README

Question 4: How to get started ?
--------------------------------

You can find 3 separate tutorials in the tutorials directory:
(Read overview.ps)

1/ ADDACCU
   The design of a very simple chip (adder/accumulator) to get started
   with the ALLIANCE tools.

   >cd tutorials/addaccu

2/ AMD2901
   The design of the 4 bits AMD2901 processor, from the VHDL specification to
   the CIF layout, using the ALLIANCE portable standard cells library.

   >cd tutorials/amd2901

3/ Data Path
   Building simple data paths using on a procedural data path generator
   (fpgen) and a data path place and route tool (dpr).

   >cd tutorials/fitpath

Question 5: What are the differences with the previous releases ?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The new features of this release are described in the CHANGES file:

> more CHANGES

Question 6: What is the supported VHDL subset ?
-----------------------------------------------

You can find a general presentation of the VHDL subset by issuing the
following commands:

> man vhdl

This gives you an hint about the supported VHDL subset.
There is actually three separate architectures types: "Structural",
"Data-flow", and "Finite-State-Machine"

> man vst

This gives you the VHDL subset supported for structural descriptions.

> man vbe

This gives you the data-flow behavioral subset supported by the simulator
ASIMUT, the logic synthesis tools BOP and SCMAP and the formal prover PROOF.

> man fsm

This gives you the VHDL subset used for Finite-State-Machine description
and supported by the FSM synthesis tool SYF.

Question 7: What is the available online documentation ?
--------------------------------------------------------

Each tools has its own manual.
All the tools rely on the use of environment variables: all the relevant
variables are listed in the `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES' section of the manual
page.

Question 8:  Where are defined the symbolic layout rules ?
----------------------------------------------------------

The symbolic layout rules are specified in the Design Rule Checker
documentation:

> man druc

Question 9:  How is performed the mapping to a target process ?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The actual conversion is performed by the s2r tool:

> man s2r

If you want to parameterize the S2R tool to a new target technology,
you must write a technology file. The method is described in the
postscript file doc/misc/process_mapping.ps

> lpr doc/misc/process_mapping.ps

Question 10: How can I get a complete paper documentation ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

We are making a printed documentation of all manuals of the
ALLIANCE tools. It will be available soon.


Question 11: What are the supported file formats ?
--------------------------------------------------

ALLIANCE tools are interfaced to generic data-structures that
support various standard file formats, thanks to a set of
specialized parsers/drivers.
UNIX environment variables are used to select one particular file format.
For a given entity, the file format is defined by the file extension.
