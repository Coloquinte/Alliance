# ===================================================================

"Alliance VLSI CAD System" is free Software.

Alliance is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
GPL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

You are welcome to use the software package even for commercial 
designs without any fee. You are just required to mention : 

" Designed with Alliance CAD system,

You can get Alliance via anonymous FTP from ftp.lip6.fr

# Downloading
# ===================================================================


You will have to download at least two files : one for the common files
of Alliance (like cells library) and another containing binaries for
your specific platform. As for now, only Linux, SunOS, Solaris and
FreeBSD are available. A Windows 95/NT release should be out this
year.


alliance-X.XX-common.tar.gz               Files common to each platform *required*

alliance-X.XX-i386-linux-Y.YY.tar.gz      Binaries Linux_elf

alliance-X.XX-sparc-sunos-Y.YY.tar.gz     Binaries SunOS

alliance-X.XX-sparc-solaris-Y.YY.tar.gz   Binaries Solaris


where X.XX is the Alliance version number (e.g.: 3.2 for Alliance 3.2)
and   Y.YY is the OS version number (e.g.: 4.1.4 for SunOS 4.1.4)

# Installation :
# ===================================================================

You *don't* need to be root to install Alliance in a directory you *own*

In the example above I assume you have logged as root

1/ cd to the directory where you want to install Alliance

  > cd /usr/local

2/ Unpack the common package

  > gunzip -c alliance-X.XX-common.tgz | tar -xf -

3/ Unpack one of the platform specific package

  > gunzip -c alliance-X.XX-linux-Y.YY.tgz | tar -xf -

4/ cd to alliance/share/etc and run the 'configure' script
   (This is the *only* script you need to run)

  > cd alliance/share/etc
  > ./configure

If you install Alliance on different platforms you'll
need to run the 'configure' script on each of them.

# Usage :
# ===================================================================

Each user has to source alc_env.[c]sh to set Alliance environment
variables to be able to run the Alliance tools.

in sh  > . [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/share/etc/alc_env.sh

in csh > source [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/share/etc/alc_env.csh

This sets various default environment variables which could be changed by user
later (Like MBK_OUT_LO to set the netlist output file format).

If you are a SysAdmin, you should consider linking these scripts in 
the system's profile (e.g.: /etc/profile.d/ on Linux) so that configuration
would be done at user login.

If you encounter problems, check the value of these variables in alc_env.[c]sh

          $ALLIANCE_OS : actually Linux
                           or SunOS
                           or Solaris

          $ALLIANCE_TOP     : actually [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/archi/Linux
                           or [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/archi/SunOS
                           or [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/archi/Solaris

That's all :-)
