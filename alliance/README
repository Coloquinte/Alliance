# Alliance 
# ===================================================================

"Alliance VLSI CAD System" is free Software.

Unlike versions of Alliance up to 3.1 that where released
including sources, version 3.2 and up will not be available
with the source code.

Source is however still available, but only upon request to
alliance-support@lip6.fr. The release of the source is now
subject to a non disclosure agreement.

You are welcome to use the software package even for commercial 
designs whithout any fee. You are just required to mention : 
"Designed with Alliance CAD system"

You can get Alliance via anonymous FTP from ftp.lip6.fr

       ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/lip6/softs/alliance/

or     ftp://ftp-asim.lip6.fr/pub/alliance/



# Downloading
# ===================================================================


You will have to download at least two files : one for the common files
of Alliance (like cells library) and another containing binaries for
your specific platform. Actually only Linux_elf, SunOS and Solaris
are supported.

alliance-3.2b-common.tar.gz                Files common to each platform *required*

alliance-3.2b-i386-linux-2.0.30.tar.gz     Binaries Linux_elf

alliance-3.2b-sparc-sunos-4.1.1.tar.gz     Binaries SunOS

alliance-3.2b-sparc-solaris-2.5.1.tar.gz   Binaries Solaris




# Installation :
# ===================================================================

You *dont* need to be root to install Alliance in a directory you *own*

In the example above I assume you have logged as root

1/ cd to the directory where you want to install Alliance

  > cd /usr/local

2/ Unpack the common package

  > gunzip -c alliance-3.2b-common.tgz | tar -pvxf -

3/ Unpack one of the platform specific package

  > gunzip -c alliance-3.2b-Linux_elf.tgz | tar -pvxf -

4/ cd to alliance/share/etc and run the 'configure' script
   (This is the *only* script you need to run)

  > cd alliance/share/etc
  > ./configure

If you install Alliance on different platforms you'll
need to run the 'configure' script on each of them


# Usage :
# ===================================================================

Each user has to source alc_env.[c]sh to set Alliance environment
variables to be able to run the Alliance tools.

in sh  > . [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/share/etc/alc_env.sh

in csh > source [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/share/etc/alc_env.csh

This could be done in system's profile (/etc/profile)...
so that it would be done at user login

This sets various default environement variables which could be changed by user
later (Like MBK_OUT_LO to set the netlist output file format).

If you encounter problems, check the value of these variables in alc_env.[c]sh

          $ALLIANCE_OS : actually Linux_elf
                           or SunOS
                           or Solaris

          $ALLIANCE_TOP     : actually [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/archi/Linux_elf
                           or [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/archi/SunOS
                           or [where you have installed Alliance]/alliance/archi/Solaris

That's all :-)
